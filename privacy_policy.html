    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the "The Protocol" app (hereby referred to
      as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ayoub Bargady
      (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service
      is intended for use "AS IS".

    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Application does not collect or transmit any personally identifiable
      information to external servers. All data (tasks, protocol history) is
      stored locally on your device using Shared Preferences.

    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider values your trust in providing your Personal
      Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of

      we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
